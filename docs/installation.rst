============
Installation
============

You can install schematics-xml either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from github.

To install using pip;

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install schematics-xml

From github;

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/alexhayes/schematics-xml.git


Currently `schematics-xml` only supports Python 3 - if you'd like feel free to
submit a PR adding support for Python 2, however note that I love type
annotations and any Python 2 PR will need to include a stub file.
